                The moon was covered by the dark clouds . The Rain had prompted for power shortage. The Generator buzzzed through the night like an old tractor going uphill "Grrr- grrr-boom". Rain beat the corrugated iron sheets then fell down to the dry ground. You ever smelt that scent from the ground right after the rain comes :) Among the thunder , A sharp cry pierced the dark night. "Ngeeeh-ngeeeeh" a baby had been born.  From the neighbours compound they heard four ullulations follow the baby's cry. That meant only one thing. The world had welcomed a bouncing baby girl. Her mother held her in her arms . Only one name was on her lips <em>Cherop</em>. Cherop will be her name.
